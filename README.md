# JavaScript Logic - Learn and Master Logical Thinking in JavaScript

## Introduction
Welcome to **JavaScript Logic**, where you will learn how to break down problems and develop strong logical thinking using JavaScript. This repository is dedicated to helping you understand how to build logic step by step, from basic concepts to advanced problem-solving techniques.

## Why Learn JavaScript Logic?
Mastering logic in JavaScript is essential because:
- It helps in **problem-solving** and **algorithm development**.
- It makes **coding easier** by improving structured thinking.
- It is a fundamental skill required in **web development**, **game development**, **data structures**, and **algorithms**.

## What You Will Learn
This repository contains different sections covering:

### 🔹 **Basic Logical Problems**
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Finding Even or Odd Numbers
- Checking for Prime Numbers
- Factorial Calculation

### 🔹 **Intermediate Logical Problems**
- Reverse a String
- Find the Largest Number in an Array
- Sort an Array (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
- Count Vowels in a String
- Palindrome Checker

### 🔹 **Advanced Logical Problems**
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Recursion Concepts
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Object Manipulation and Functional Programming

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CodeWithSMR/JavaScript-Logic.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```sh
   cd JavaScript-Logic
   ```
3. Open `index.js` in your code editor and start coding!

## Example: Simple Sum Function
Here is a basic example of how logic is built in JavaScript:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let result = addNumbers(5, 10);
console.log("Sum is:", result); // Output: Sum is: 15
```
